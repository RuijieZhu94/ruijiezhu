Biography
------

I am currently a postgraduate student working with Prof. Zhang Yongdong and Prof. Zhang Tianzhu at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). I got the B.S. degree in computer science at Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU) in 2022.

My research interest includes 3D reconstruction, SLAM and computer vision.
